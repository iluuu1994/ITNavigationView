Usage
-----

### Copy files

Copy the following files:

* `ITNavigationView.h`
* `ITNavigationView.m`

Make sure to copy them to the project, and to add them to the target.
Also, make sure to include the QuartzCore framework.

### Use in a project

Drag a custom view onto your window.
Set it's custom class to `ITNavigationView`.

Now you can connect an outlet to it, and use the following methods and properties:

    @property (nonatomic, strong) NSViewController *currentViewController;
    
    - (void)setCurrentViewController:(NSViewController *)currentViewController
                  withAnimationStyle:(ITNavigationViewAnimationStyle)animationStyle;
                  
    - (void)setCurrentViewController:(NSViewController *)currentViewController
                       withAnimation:(BOOL)animationFlag;
                       
    @property ITNavigationViewAnimationStyle animationStyle;
    @property (nonatomic) NSTimeInterval animationDuration;
    @property (nonatomic, strong) CAMediaTimingFunction *timingFunction;
    @property (nonatomic) BOOL fadeAnimation;
